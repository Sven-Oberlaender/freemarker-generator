    <title>What's FreeMarker Generator?</title>

    <remark>Up until "Quick fasts", this is mostly new content compared to the
    Markdown version.</remark>

    <warning>
      <para><emphasis>No backward compatibility is promised!</emphasis>
      FreeMarker Generator is in early stage of development, and so new
      versions can break backward compatibility. However, the template engine
      itself (FreeMarker) keeps backward compatibility, so hopefully the bulk
      of your work can be still used in a future versions of FreeMarker
      Generator, should you decide to upgrade it.</para>
    </warning>

    <para>FreeMarker Generator is a command line tool that generates files
    based on FreeMarker template files, and data that's typically provided in
    files (such as JSON files, CSV files, etc.) as well. It can be used to
    generated source code, configuration files, etc.</para>

    </itemizedlist>

    <note>
      <para>Currently, FreeMarker Generator can only be invoked via command
      line interface (CLI). In the future, we might add other interfaces, like
      a Maven plugin. Actually, there's already a FreeMarker Generator Maven
      plugin, but that doesn't share code, or concepts with the CLI. In the
      future, we hope to unite these into a common engine. But for now the
      Maven plugin is considered to be a legacy artifact. However, it works,
      and you can use it. But anything you see in this documentation is not
      applicable there, except this: [TODO copy and link plugin Maven
      site]</para>

        <para>On my local box (Mac OS 10.15.5) I use the following
        setup:</para>

        <remark>This above have used export FREEMARKER_CLI_HOME=..., but I
        found that to be confusing, as one my thinks FREEMARKER_CLI_HOME is

        <title>Transforming GitHub JSON To Markdown</title>

        <para>A simple example with real JSON data to be transformed into

        <para>You can either use the existing JSON sample</para>

        <programlisting>&gt; freemarker-generator -t examples/templates/json/md/github-users.ftl examples/data/json/github-users.json</programlisting>

        <para>or pipe a <literal>curl</literal> response</para>

        <para>Below you see the Apache FreeMarker Template:</para>

        <programlisting role="template">[docgen.insertFile "@exampleTemplates/json/md/github-users.ftl"]</programlisting>

        <para>This creates the following output:</para>

        Markdown or HTML - there are on-line solutions
        available<remark>[removed external product link from here]</remark>,
        but having a local solution gives you more flexibility.</para>

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        <para>The FreeMarker Generator source code doesn't include

        include any cryptography software. Hence, FreeMarker has no Export

        the label "not subject to EAR" could be used.</para>
